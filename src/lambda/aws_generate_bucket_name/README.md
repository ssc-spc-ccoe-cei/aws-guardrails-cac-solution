## lambda_handler

Lambda function to create evidence bucket and AWS Config bucket.

**Parameters**

- `event`: The event data passed to the lambda handler
- `context`: The lambda context object

**Returns**

None

This is the main entry point for the lambda function. It handles Create, Update and Delete events from CloudFormation.

For Create events, it generates random suffix strings for the EvidenceBucketName and AWSConfigBucketName and returns them in the response. 

For Update events, it simply returns the PhysicalResourceId in lowercase.

For Delete events, it also returns the PhysicalResourceId in lowercase.

For any other event types, it raises an error.

After constructing the response, it calls the `send()` function to send the response back to CloudFormation.
